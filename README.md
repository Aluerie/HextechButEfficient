# 🔠 HextechButEfficient

League of Legends [LCU API](<https://riot-api-libraries.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lcu.html>) scripts for quick &amp; efficient management of some chores in a min-max style.

> **Note**
> You can use GUI from Release App as well as run yourself `main.py` or separate scripts in folder `scripts/` yourself.

No more annoying animations, no more chore calculations, no more chore lookups in other tab like "do I have mastery 7 on that champ?". Say "No more" to any inefficiency.

## 🪚 Ideas and Contributions

Feel free to make contributions, reach me with your ideas and suggestions, report bugs, etc.

## 👊 Riot Games Approval

Sorry, I'm yet to send a request for approval.

Either way, it's more of a formality, you will not get banned for using this tool/scripts. Many similar applications that also use LCU API with different purposes already exist and have no problems. Honourable mention: [HextechButBetter](https://github.com/MaciejGorczyca/HextechButBetter) repository.

## 🚫 No Personal Responsibility Disclaimer

I am not to be held responsible for any losses, mistakes and "mistakes", or bugs that can lead to unfortunate situations. Use/modify my scripts on your own risk. Well, I mean, they should be fine, but still, if anything happens - I won't be able to refund those shards back or something.

## 🌗 Last Note

Not sure if I like the name `HextechButEfficient` because we have some non-loot scripts too. Not sure if wordplay of famous [HextechButBetter](https://github.com/MaciejGorczyca/HextechButBetter) project is a fine idea too. If you have any suggestions - please, hit me up.
