# 🔠 HextechButEfficient

League of Legends [LCU API](<https://riot-api-libraries.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lcu.html>) scripts for quick &amp; efficient management of some chores in a min-max style.

> [!NOTE]
> You can use GUI from [Release App](https://github.com/Aluerie/HextechButEfficient/releases) as well as run yourself `main.py` or separate scripts from the folder `scripts/` yourself.

No more annoying animations, no more chore calculations, no more chore lookups in other tab like "do I have mastery 7 on that champ?". Say "No more" to any inefficiency.

![Alt text](extra_assets/readme/approved.png)

That means, you will not be banned for using the tool. Either way, many already existing applications: like Mobalytics/Blitz or Open Source ones - honourable mention [HextechButBetter](https://github.com/MaciejGorczyca/HextechButBetter) (yes, the name of this repository is a reference to it 🙂 ) use LCU API for different purposes without any problems.

## 🚫 No Personal Responsibility Disclaimer

Despite section above, I am not to be held responsible for any losses, mistakes and "mistakes", or bugs that can lead to unfortunate situations. Use/modify my scripts on your own risk. Well, I mean, they should be fine, but still, if anything happens - I won't be able to refund those shards back or something.
